    "# Digraphs in Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "In cryptography, a **digraph** is a pair of consecutive letters treated as a single unit during the encoding and decoding processes. This approach can enhance security by encoding pairs of letters together, making it more challenging to perform frequency analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Digraphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using digraphs instead of single letters makes cryptographic attacks, like frequency analysis, more difficult. This is because the patterns in pairs of letters (digraphs) are more complex and less predictable than those of individual letters.\n",

    "1. Perform frequency analysis on the ciphertext to identify common digraphs.\n",
    "2. Use your analysis to guess the corresponding plaintext digraphs.\n",
    "3. Determine the deciphering matrix based on your guesses.\n",
    "4. Decode the message using the deciphering matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. **Frequency Analysis**: Analyze the ciphertext stored in ciphertext1 and ciphertext2 for the most frequent digraphs.\n",
    "2. **Guesses**: Suppose \"KH\" and \"XW\" are the most frequent digraphs in the ciphertext. You might guess these correspond to \"TH\" and \"HE\" in plaintext.\n",
    "3. **Deciphering Matrix**: Use these guesses to find the matrix that can decipher the message.\n",

    "Having the opportunity to work on a cryptography project in a group setting was a great opportunity to learn and apply what we have learned throughout the semester. We took time to individually and collectively reflect on our thoughts on the project, whether that be on how the content itself or dealing with new problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking time to expand on ciphers was what fuelled us to take on the cryptography option, as we remembered the brief introduction we got on previous Python homework. During the project, we definitely got a deeper understanding of them by taking on bugs and questions head-on. For example, on exercise 4, we had an odd bug that incorrectly parsed and inserted spaces. The team came together for a sprint to solve the problem with everyone’s feedback. This took an hour and half, and members had to become closely acquainted with the exact reasoning behind modulo shifts in ciphers. By coming together for that sprint, we were able to get the right solution approved and merged. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our team also spent a large chunk of time researching for this project; in particular, modulo inverses. One struggle we had was understanding how in-depth the instructions wanted us to go. For exercise 2, taking time to dissect what it meant to apply a modular inverse to the project was key. Even though we started that conversation a little disoriented, by the end of the meeting we had clear goals and revisions ready to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to debug these topics and refine our solutions was only possible through communication (2 meetings with defined goals, emails, and messages) and a group effort to refine code, which we did using pull request reviews in GitHub and meetings. By staying rigorous in our communication and work, we were able to complete the project feeling confident in our work and our expertise. \n"
